# diffSteerWithD-Pad
A high level / basic guide for differential steering with a D-Pad (joystick)

In the initial stages of a previous project, I was intent on using differential steering to control a robot.  I knew generally how differential steering worked, but I found there wasn't much out there in terms of implementation guides.  Further, I found there was practically NO information available on using a joystick (D-Pad) within the context of differential steering.  This isn't necessarily a difficult topic.  In fact, it's pretty basic, however, it does require a little bit of thought -- it's my intent here to share some of that thought with you.
